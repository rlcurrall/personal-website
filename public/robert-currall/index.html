              About Robert Currall
          </h2>
		  <p>
			  I am currently a student at the University of South Carolina Beaufort where I am studying Computational Science. I enrolled in USCB in the fall of 2016 and have started my second semester, currently holding a 4.0 institutional GPA.
		  </p>
          <p>
              Before I attended USCB I was a student at Coastal Carolina University from the fall of 2011 to the spring of 2015, at which point I made the move from Myrtle Beach and began the enrollment process at USCB. I studied Applied Mathematics at CCU but after taking a couple of computer science courses and then a course in cryptography I realized that I was in the wrong major and that computers were my passion.
          </p>

          <p>
              I am currently enrolled at the University of South Carolina, Beaufort. I transfered from
              Coastal Carolina University which I atteneded from the Fall of 2011 to the Spring of 2015.
              While at CCU, I studied Applied Mathematics and Pre-engineering. After taking a break for a year, I applied to USCB and began studying Computational Science. Here are some of the more notable courses I've taken and what they have encompassed.

          <p>
              For my first semester at USCB I took a class on HTML web developement, Java programming, and database system management. For my HTML and Java classes there was a competition for the final project. In the HTML class each student was to build a personal website about themselves. For this competition I tied for second place, <a>here</a> is the submission I presented for the project, I modified the code from the project to create this website.
          </p>

          </figure>
          <p>
              For the competition in the Java class, students were to create a video game in the Greenfoot IDE that was based on Spanish culture. In this competition I tied for third place, <a>here</a> is a link to the submission. For my video game I attempted to create a Civilization-like game based on the settlement of Santa Elena on modern-day Parris Island.
